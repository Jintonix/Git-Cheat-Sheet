\section{Remotes}
- What is a remote: 
- showing Remotes
- adding remotes + shortname
\section{Fetch \& Pull}
git fetch updates your local repository’s knowledge of the remote, not your working branch.\\
fetch -> make sure your local Git knows about the latest main on the server.\\

Git pull syntax:\\
git pull <remote> <branch>
\\
For pulling into a branch while on a different branch:\\
git fetch origin main:main\\
git fetch <remote> <src>:<dst>\\
- <remote> → which remote to fetch from (e.g. origin).

- <src> → branch (or ref) on the remote.

- <dst> → branch (or ref) in your local repo to update.
